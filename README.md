### Current projects

#### Feedback app (private repository)

The purpose of this project is to develop a simple distributed system to collect client feedback after their appointment. This app targets Samsung Tablet A8 in both landscape or portrait screen. I am using agile delivery with Jira as my prefered software development tools. The client uses Apple products that is why the prototype is loosely inspired by Apple's Human Interface Guidelines Cupertino.
