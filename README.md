Trivia night flutter mobile app (private repository)

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself into a new technology (Flutter) to develop a mobile ready app. This project uses provider package for state management and trivia-api. Current features includes toggle dark mode, sound, and user able to review their score. This is a private repository hosted here in GitHub but I am willing to show the codebase or send the .apk file to employers.
